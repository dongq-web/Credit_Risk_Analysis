So our focus is on the precision rate of class 1. From the classification report of the first model, we can see that the precision rate of class 1 is 0.86, or 86%. This means among all the loans identified as to be fully paid by the classification model, 86% of them are actually fully paid. This is a not much better than the repaid rate of the whole test set, which is about 85%. The reason is that the model only has 0.07 recall rate on class 0, which means, for all loans that are charged off, the model only identifies 7% of them as charged off.\n",

The default RandomForestClassifier is not very senstive to class_weight change, so we also limit `max_depth` to increase the effectiveness of class_weight change.\n",

    "From the classification report of the second Random Forest Classifier, we can see that even though the accuracy rate drops to 65%, the model has a lot larger class 0 recall at 0.44.

    "\n",
    "$TotalReturn = \\frac{Total Payment}{Funded Amount} - 1$\n",

    "Again, this is not the true annualized return of a loan. But the goal of this project is to identify loans to invest, so we just need a benchmark to evaluate loan portfolio performance.\n",

    "In the following code cells, we define a function to calculate annual return of a loan portfolio. The function calculates annual return for 36 month and 60 month loans in a portfolio separately. \n",

    "\n",
    "In the RandomForestClassifier demo, we don't include loan term in the training features. But as shown in task 2.1, 36 months loans have much higher paid-off rate than that of 60 months loans. It seems obvious that loan term should be included in the training feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code cells, we will add loan_term_year to the training feature and train the RandomForestClassifier with class_weight='balanced'.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we add loan_term_year to model_columns.\n",
    "Then, we create d_train with the new model_columns.\n",
    "Then, we train and predict with the RandomForestClassifier.\n",
    "Fianlly, we check the portfolio return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing to the portfolio selected by rfc2, in the new portfolio, 36 months loan return drops a bit and 60 months loan return increases a bit. But the biggest impact is that in the new portfolio, there are 10 times more 36 months loans than 60 months loans. While in the dataset, the ratio is about 3 to 1. The reason is that since 36 months loans have much higher repaid rate, when we set class_weight='balanced', the model will bias toward 36 months loans."
